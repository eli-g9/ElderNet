# ElderNet

This is the implementation of [Automated Gait Detection in Daily Living Settings from a Wrist-Worn Accelerometer in Older Adults Using Self-Supervised Learning](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-4102403/v1).  
Here, we developed and evaluated a gait detection deep learning approach, termed ElderNet, that was oriented and optimized for older adults and, in particular, those who might have impaired gait. The first stage involved the training of an SSL model, utilizing the pre-trained [UK Biobank model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.02909)
This SSL model was extensively modified in both architecture and training cohorts to include a large unlabeled dataset of more than 1000 older adults with and without impaired gait who wore a wrist-worn device for up to 10 days and were participating in the [RUSH Memory and Aging Project](https://www.radc.rush.edu/home.htm;jsessionid=B4B2994C88E8AC9ED3737F576F1BE36E). Next, we fine-tuned the model on a labeled dataset consisting of 83 older adults from the [Mobilise-D](https://mobilise-d.eu/) data, each wearing a wrist-worn accelerometer for approximately 2.5 hours.
